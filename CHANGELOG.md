# CHANGELOG

## Master (unreleased)

### 0.8.0
* Updates to Ruby 2.4.3
* Switches to use Biola's forked and updated [Weary](https://github.com/biola/weary) gem which supports Rack 2.0. The upgrade is required to update Rails to version 5.x. Once the Trogdir infrastructure project is complete this gem should be deprecated.
